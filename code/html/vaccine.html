            <h1>COVID-19 VACCINATION</h1>
            <p>Over 294 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been given in the United States from December 14, 2020,
                through May 31, 2021.

                COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of
                participants in clinical trials.
                The vaccines met the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) rigorous scientific standards for safety,
                effectiveness,
                and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA). Learn more about EUAs in
                this videoexternal icon.


                Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines since they were authorized for
                emergency use by FDA.
                These vaccines have undergone and will continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S.
                history.
                This monitoring includes using both established and new safety monitoring systems to make sure that
                COVID-19 vaccines are safe.
                This data shows how many people have received at least one dose of a vaccine. People who are fully
                vaccinated may have received more than one dose

                    <h2>Vaccination for children</h2>

                    <p>
                        CDC recommends everyone 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 vaccination to help protect
                        against COVID-19.
                        Widespread vaccination is a critical tool to help stop the pandemic. People who are fully
                        vaccinated can resume activities
                        that they did prior to the pandemic.
                        Learn more about what you and your child or teen can do when you have been fully vaccinated.
                        Children 12 years and
                        older are able to get the
                        Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
                        <br>
                        Although fewer children have been infected with COVID-19 compared to adults, children can:<br />

                        Be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19<br />
                        Get sick from COVID-19<br />
                        Spread COVID-19 to others

                        <br>
                        Find a COVID-19 Vaccine for Your Child
                        Check your local pharmacy’s website to see if vaccination walk-ins or appointments are
                        available.
                        Check with your child’s healthcare provider about whether they offer COVID-19 vaccination.
                        Contact your state or local health department for more information.
