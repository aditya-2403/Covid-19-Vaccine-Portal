                    stung millions of poor in the world's second-most populous country, leaving many hungry and forcing

                    to flee cities and walk hundreds of kilometres to their native villages. Rickshaw pullers, itinerant

                    day labourers and other informal workers form the backbone of the Indian economy, comprising about

                        The unprecedented lockdown has stung millions of poor in the world's populous country
                        "Ultimately, the greatest lesson that COVID-19 can teach humanity is that we are all in this

                <h2>Food Insecurity</h2>
                <p>since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity has increased in the United States and
                    India
                    This is particularly true for households with young children. I document new evidence from two
                    nationally
                    representative surveys that were initiated to provide up-to-date estimates of the consequences of
                    the COVID-19 pandemic,
                    including the incidence of food insecurity. Food insecurity occurs when a household has difficulty
                    providing enough food due to a
                    lack of resources. Households and children are considered food insecure if the respondent indicates
                    the following statements were
                    often or sometimes true: The food we bought just didn’t last and we didn’t have enough money to get
                    more. The children
                    in my household were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food. Agnivesh, a
                    social worker who is
                    providing two meals to the migrant workers in Delhi, said, "They are the worst hit. If we do not
                    give them food they will
                    die of starvation. They contacted us a few weeks back they had been starving. We contacted our
                    friends and raised fund.
                    Initially we could not provide for all but now with more people donating we are able to get them two
                    meals a day."

                    The government has announced three months free ration for all National Food Security Act
                    beneficiaries,
                    but the beneficiaries could hardly receive the full quota.</p>

                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                <p>
                    Transportation is one of the major sectors, which has been severely affected by the impact of the
                    COVID-19 pandemic.
                    A survey was conducted by the Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR) from June to July 2020,
                    among experts from the transportation sector to understand their perception of the effects of the
                    pandemic on the sector in India.
                    A total of 15 experts consisting of academicians, practitioners, policy makers and researchers, from
                    different parts of the country,
                    who were closely working with the transportation sector were interviewed. As the country continues
                    to live with the pandemic and an
                    unforeseeable end to the crisis, many questions arise regarding the future of the passenger
                    transportation sector in India.
                    Transportation organizations will need to ensure that transportation networks can continue to
                    operate throughout the lockdown measures,
                    striking a balance between reduced operations and providing enough capacity for key workers to be
                    able to practice social distancing.
                    Longer-term investment programs may need to be replanned and reprioritized in light of decreased
                    revenue. Organizations will
                    need to plan for the availability of key personnel to ensure that staff with critical skills and
                    training are available
                    throughout the coronavirus pandemic to keep networks operational. Commuting and traveling patterns
                    may not recover to
                    their pre–COVID-19 state once lockdowns are lifted.

                <h2>Economy Impact</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The Indian economy was expected to lose over ₹32,000 crore (US$4.5 billion) every day during the
                    first
                    21-days of complete lockdown, which was declared following the coronavirus outbreak. Under complete
                    lockdown,
                    less than a quarter of India's $2.8 trillion economic movement was functional. India faces a huge
                    decline in government
                    revenues and growth of the income for at least two quarters as the coronavirus hits economic
                    activity of the country as a whole.
                    A fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization plans, government and industry.The economy of
                    covid impact f COVID-19 is
                    very disturbing. No one has been spared of its ill effects. Economies of about 100 plus countries
                    have been destroyed
                    out of which some of them have asked for monetary help from IMF. Businesses across the world namely
                    hospitality,
                    entertainment, aviation etc have seen a major negative impact. Various sports events such as IPL and
                    Olympics have
                    been postponed. Schools and colleges have been closed. The virus has also disrupted the functioning
                    of various online
                    giants such as Amazon. Countries such as USA, Italy and Spain are suffering the most since their
                    death toll is very high.
                    Impact on Economy(financial): There is a big shift in the world economic market and the share market
                    has witnessed crashes
                    day by day. Factories, Restaurants, Pubs, Markets, Flights, Super Markets, Malls, Universities and
                    Colleges etc. were shut down.
                    Fear of corona virus has limited the movement of the individuals. People were not even going to buy
                    the daily essentials and these
                    all were somewhere impacting the economy of the world as a whole. The Organization for Economic
                    Co-operation and Development
                    (OECD)reveals that they have cut their expectation for global growth to 2.4% from 2.9%, and warns
                    that it could fall as low as
                    1.5%. India faces a huge decline in government revenues and growth of the income for at least two
                    quarters as the coronavirus
                    hits economic activity of the country as a whole. A fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization
                    plans, government and industry.
                    The lockdown in India will have a sizeable impact on the economy mainly on consumption which is the
                    biggest component of GDP.
                    India’s total electronic imports is equal to 45% that of China. Around one-third of machinery and
                    almost two-fifths of organic
                    chemicals that India purchases come from China. For automotive parts and fertilisers China’s share
                    in India’s import is more than
                    25%. Around 65 to 70% of active pharmaceutical ingredients and around 90% of certain mobile phones
                    come from China to India.
                    Individuals who work for businesses heavily involved in international trade have felt the impact
                    most directly,
                    with loss of bonus and other incentive pay often followed by furloughs and possibly even temporary
                    or permanent job loss.
                    This is worst-case scenario, of course, but it is not uncommon, even in the current state of
                    diminishing panic coming from
                    government, business, and other societal sources. As the economic contraction turns into a
                    longer-term economic recession,
                    you can expect high unemployment figures to continue, along with lower wages as more job seekers
                    compete
                    for fewer available jobs. However, given the broader stability in the economy prior to the pandemic,
                    long-term recovery seems certain, although what it will look like is still up for debate.</p>

                    witnessing a crisis that has turned the world upside down. The Covid-19 pandemic has infected
                    nearly 12 million people worldwide and taken the lives of around 5,50,000. As I finish writing this
                    article,
                    that number may be inaccurate. As schools remain shut, educators must quickly embrace basic
                    technology.
                    Local governments should simultaneously start investing in hardware - like tablets and phones - for
                    classrooms.
                    They may be our new textbooks. At Teach For India, our Fellows our Fellows are prototyping Google
                    Classroom and other
                    applications to facilitate virtual instruction. We have to ensure that learning doesn’t stop. Many
                    poor people are unable
                    to afford data plans for their study through online so they have quit studying at this terrible time
                    .so governments should
                    take action providing them a free data plan atleast 1GB and providing them minimal cost
                    smartphones.Conducting offline mode
                    is not a good idea as it effects their health and they cant afford doctor's fee so it is necessary
                    to take the required
                    steps by government.
